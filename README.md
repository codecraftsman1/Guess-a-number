This is a simple number guessing game built with Python. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback — “Too high” or “Too low” — until the correct number is guessed.

🎮 How It Works
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The user keeps guessing the number.

After each guess, the program gives a hint:

"Too high" if the guess is above the number.

"Too low" if the guess is below the number.

When the user guesses correctly, the game congratulates them.
